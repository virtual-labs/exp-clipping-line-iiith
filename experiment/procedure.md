1. **Set Clipping Window Size:**
   - Fix the size of the clipping window using the default parameters already filled in the input boxes.
   - Click on **Enter** to confirm the chosen window size.

2. **Start Experiment with Default Values:**
   - Alternatively, proceed directly to the experiment using the default parameters of the clipping window and the starting and ending coordinates.
   - Click on **Start Experiment with Default Values** to initiate the experiment.

3. **Customize Starting and Ending Coordinates:**
   - Fix the starting and ending coordinates based on your preferences. Default values are provided and can be modified in the input boxes.
   - Once coordinates are finalized, click on **Start Experiment** to commence the experiment.
   - If needed, you can go **Back** to adjust the values of the frame buffer.

4. **Navigate Through Experiment Steps:**
   - Throughout the experiment, use **Next Iteration** to progress to the next step of the algorithm.
   - Utilize **Previous Iteration** to go back to the previous step if necessary.

5. **Conclude Experiment:**
   - Once the experiment concludes, you have the option to experiment with a new line.
   - Explore different scenarios by adjusting parameters and repeating the process.

This procedure guides you through the setup and execution of the Cohen-Sutherland Line Clipping Algorithm experiment, providing flexibility in customizing parameters and navigating through the iterations.
