    "question": "3. What is the primary objective of line clipping in computer graphics?",
    "answers": {
      "a": "To increase rendering time",
      "b": "To remove unnecessary portions of lines outside the display area",
      "c": "To add texture to lines",
      "d": "To reduce image resolution"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "b",
    "explanations": {
      "a": "Line clipping aims to optimize rendering time, not increase it.",
      "b": "Correct! The primary goal is to eliminate parts of lines outside the display area.",
      "c": "Adding texture to lines is not the primary purpose of line clipping.",
