1. **Fix the Size of the Clipping Window**: Set the parameters defining the boundaries of the clipping window using the values already filled in the input boxes.

2. **Fix Line Coordinates**: Enter or adjust the starting and ending coordinates of the line segment. Ensure these coordinates are set correctly to define the line you want to clip.

3. **Proceed to the Experiment**: Click on **Submit** to begin the experiment with the defined parameters for the clipping window and the line coordinates.

4. **Navigate Through the Experiment**:
   - Use **Next Iteration** to advance to the next step of the Cohen-Sutherland algorithm, which clips the line segment according to the defined clipping window.
   - Use **Previous Iteration** to move back to the previous step if needed, allowing you to review each stage of the clipping process.
   - Use the **Reset** button to clear the current experiment and start new with default parameters for the clipping window and line coordinates.

5. **End of Experiment**: Upon completion of the experiment, you can:
   - Start a new experiment with different starting and ending coordinates for the line within the same clipping window.
   - Adjust the parameters of the clipping window to experiment with different clipping scenarios.
