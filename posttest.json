    "correctAnswer": "c",
    "explanations": {
      "a": "Render space is not a common term for the display area.",
      "b": "While correct, a more specific term is commonly used in computer graphics.",
      "c": "Correct! The region within the display area is often referred to as the clipped window.",
      "d": "Display zone is not the commonly used term in this context."

      "a": "Cohen-Sutherland",
      "b": "Liang-Barsky",
      "c": "Nicholl-Lee-Nicholl",
      "d": "Bubble Sort"

    "correctAnswer": "d",
    "explanations": {
      "a": "Cohen-Sutherland is a line clipping algorithm.",
      "b": "Liang-Barsky is a line clipping algorithm.",
      "c": "Nicholl-Lee-Nicholl is a line clipping algorithm.",
      "d": "Correct! Bubble Sort is a sorting algorithm, not a line clipping algorithm."

    "question": "3. Which geometric concept is central to line clipping algorithms?",
    "answers": {
      "a": "Translation",
      "b": "Rotation",
      "c": "Projection",
      "d": "Intersection"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "d",
    "explanations": {
      "a": "Translation involves shifting, not clipping.",
      "b": "Rotation deals with turning or spinning, not clipping.",
      "c": "Projection involves mapping 3D to 2D, not clipping.",
      "d": "Correct! Line clipping algorithms often rely on the concept of intersection for determining visibility."
