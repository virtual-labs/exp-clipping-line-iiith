1. **Fix the Size of the Clipping Window**: Set the parameters defining the boundaries of the clipping window using the values already filled in the input boxes.

2. **Fix Line Coordinates**: Enter or adjust the starting and ending coordinates of the line segment. Ensure these coordinates are set correctly to define the line you want to clip.

3. **Proceed to the Experiment**: Click on **Submit** to begin the experiment with the defined parameters for the clipping window and the line coordinates.

4. **Navigate Through the Experiment**:
   - Use **Next Iteration** to advance through the Cohen-Sutherland algorithm steps:
     - The algorithm will check if points are inside the clipping window
     - Compute intersection points with window boundaries
     - Draw the clipped line segments
   - Use **Previous Iteration** to move back to the previous step, allowing you to review:
     - The state of the line at each step
     - Intersection points computed
     - Clipping decisions made
   - Use the **Reset** button to clear the current experiment and start new with default parameters

5. **Monitor the Experiment Progress**:
   - Watch the **Observations** column on the right side for:
     - Current step message explaining what's happening
     - Logic text showing the current clipping operation
     - Point status showing which point is being processed
     - Line status showing which boundary is being checked
     - Table showing coordinates of points and intersections

6. **End of Experiment**: Upon completion of the experiment, you can:
   - Start a new experiment with different starting and ending coordinates for the line within the same clipping window
   - Adjust the parameters of the clipping window to experiment with different clipping scenarios
   - Review the final clipped line and all intermediate steps using the Previous Iteration button
